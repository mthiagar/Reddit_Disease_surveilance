    "That's all for this tutorial. Now, keep in mind, this was just for demonstration purposes of how to pull data from reddit for purpose of disease surveillance, and prep it for analysis. What we did here is very simplistic and, you can't draw any conclusions from it. We need to adust for the growth in users, and total number of posts each month etc. to get a realistic picture of whether depression related posts are on the rise, and if the trend is even significant. We would also, need to have a more stringent criteria for what determines a depression related post (some of those posts just have the word depressed, but don't have much to do with depression). But, what we do show here is, how an API can be used get data for disease surveilance. Analysis is often much trickier and often requires more domain expertise. Hope you enjoyed it!"
